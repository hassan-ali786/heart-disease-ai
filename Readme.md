# Heart Disease Prediction System

A production-ready web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using Machine Learning and presents results through a structured and user-friendly dashboard.

This project is suitable for data science portfolios, machine learning demonstrations, and healthcare analytics prototypes.

## Example Input

| Parameter        | Value |
|-----------------|------|
| Age             | 52   |
| Blood Pressure  | 130  |
| Cholesterol     | 250  |
| Max Heart Rate  | 150  |
| Oldpeak         | 1.5  |

## How It Works

1. User inputs medical data through the web interface  
2. Data is sent to the Flask backend  
3. The trained model processes the input  
4. The system returns:
   - Risk percentage  
   - Risk category  
   - Visual representation of patient metrics

## Machine Learning Details

- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier  
- Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset (CSV format)  
- Workflow:
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Feature selection  
  - Model training  
  - Model serialization using `.pkl`  

---

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset is placed inside the `dataset/` directory  
- The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory  
- Python 3.8 or higher is recommended  
- For PDF functionality, install `wkhtmltopdf`
